# Fleetr: Demand Prediction for Vehicle Logistics 

I did my insight project with a startup, Fleetr*.
Fleetr delivers rental cars.
A customer can book a car through their mobile app and they will have an agent deliver the car directly to the customer at the given time and location.
They are more like a mobility provider. They don’t own cars. They partner with local car rental companies to server their customers.
