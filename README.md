I did my insight project with a startup, Fleetr*.
Fleetr delivers rental cars.
A customer can book a car through their mobile app and they will have an agent deliver the car directly to the customer at the given time and location.
They are more like a mobility provider. They don’t own cars. They partner with local car rental companies to server their customers.

# The Challenge
The biggest challenge they are facing right now is to predict the demand at a given time, which is extremely important to the ground logistics of an on-demand company like Fleetr. This is a very challenging problem considering how many factors could affect the demand, and how those factors vary from region to region. Currently, they don’t have any prediction system working. They get the car from their partner companies according to the booking request. If they don’t have enough in their parking lot, they will try to get more from their partners. This is where I can help them – making a predictive model. Anything is better than nothing!
